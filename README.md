## Week 7, Data Analytics Fundamentals

<hr>

This repo contains work for the final week of Data Analytics Fundamentals.  In this Repo, there is one Jupyter Notebook, as well as a resource CSV file.  In the notebook, a lambda expression for converting Fahrenheit temperatures into Celsius values is presented first.  This lambda function is then used with a list comprehension to create a list of tuples that contain a pair of values: a Fahrenheit temperature, and its equivalent value in Celsius.  This is then charted on a graph to show the relationship between the two values.

Next, the notebook contains an analysis of average high temperatures in the month of January over many years.  This data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and briefly analyzed.  After this analysis, linear regression is performed on this data set using two different Python libraries, SciPy and SKLearn.  These methods are shown with step-by-step instructions and the resulting data between the two methods is compared.
